Professors
a. Given the social security number of a professor, list the titles, classrooms,
meeting days and time of his/her classes

(This only needs the Professor SSN)

SELECT C.Ctitle, SC.Classroom, GROUP_CONCAT(M.Day_no) AS Days, SC.Begin_time, SC.End_time
FROM Professor AS P, Section AS SC, Meeting AS M, Course AS C
WHERE P.SSN = SC.P_SSN AND SC.Section_number = M.Section_Number 
AND C.Course_ID = SC.Course_ID AND P.SSN = 111111111 /*Replace with target ssn*/
GROUP BY C.Course_ID;

b.  Given a course number and a section number, count how many students get each distinct grade, i.e.  ‘A’, ‘A-’, ‘B+’, ‘B’, ‘B-’, etc.

(This needs Course Number AND Section Number)

SELECT E.Grade, Count(*) AS Count FROM Enrollment AS E, Course AS C, Section AS SC
WHERE C.Course_ID = "MATH-250A" AND SC.Section_number = 13071
AND E.Section_Number = SC.Section_number
GROUP BY E.Grade;

Students

a. Given a course number list the sections of the course, including the classrooms, the meeting days and time, and the number of students enrolled in
each section

(This only needs the Course Number)

SELECT SC.Section_number, SC.Classroom, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT M.Day_no) AS DAYS, SC.Begin_time, SC.End_time, Count(S.CWID)
FROM Student AS S, Enrollment AS E, Section AS SC, Meeting AS M, Course AS C
WHERE C.Course_ID = "MATH-250A" /*Replace with course no*/
AND C.Course_ID = M.Course_ID AND M.Section_Number = SC.Section_number 
AND S.CWID = E.CWID AND E.Section_Number = SC.Section_number
GROUP BY SC.Section_Number;

b. Given the campus wide ID of a student, list all courses the student took
and the grades.

(This only needs the student's CWID)

SELECT C.Course_ID, E.Grade
FROM Student AS S, Enrollment AS E, Section AS SC, Course AS C
WHERE S.CWID = 800001111 /*Replace with target cwid*/
AND S.CWID = E.CWID AND C.Course_ID = SC.Course_ID AND E.Section_Number = SC.Section_number;
